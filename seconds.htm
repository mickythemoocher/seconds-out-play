Referee: Laaaadiiiies and geeeeeentlemen. Tonight we have a very fine boxing match between Bruiser and Hammerhead.<p> Two of the roughest, toughest,
 meanest boxers in the entire world. So let's get them into the ring. Right now.<p>
Tom: Now this is your biggest fight, do you feel ready Bruiser?<p>
 Bruiser:Well, I am feeling a little sleepy but I'm sure that will pass<p><p>
Tom: Sleepy? Sleepy? You mustn't feel sleepy, this is the fight of your life so wakey wakey and get your head on the match.
Bruiser: ( A big yawn) Yes, alright then boss.<p>
Referee:Come on now you two brutes. Let's be having you in the ring.<p>
Alice: (to Hammerhead) You are fighting fit today Hammerhead. Are you ready for this big match?<p>
Hammerhead: Hmm, I guess so<p>
Alice:  (A little angry)You guess so? You guess so? Hammerhead this is the most important night of your life. You just have to win.<p>
Hammerhead: ( A little disinterested) I just kind of wish it was tomorrow instead.<p>
Alice: Well it isn't tomorrow it is tonight, so get yourself into a fighting mood.<p>
Referee: So ladies and gentlemen, in the blue corner we have your own, your very own Bruuuuuissser.<p>
Tom: Ok, into that ring and look sharp.<p>
(There are cheers and boo's from the crowd as Bruiser climbs into the ring)<p>
Referee: And in the red corner, all the way from the other side of town we have the mighty man himself Haaaaaaaaaammmmmerhead.<p>
(More cheers and boo's from the crowd as Hammerhead joins Bruiser in the ring)
Referee: There will be 10, three minute rounds, so touch gloves gentlemen and let the boxing begin.<p>
(There is a moment or two of silence.<p>
Referee: Come on you two let the fight begin, start boxing.<p>
Bruiser: Do you want to punch me first or shall I punch you?<p>
Hammerhead: I don't mind really, which do you prefer?<p>
Bruiser: I think I usually let the other chap have the first punch<p>
Hammerhead: Aww that makes me feel a bit mean, punching you when you haven't punched me.<p>
Bruiser: Yes I think I would feel the same.<p>
Hammerhead: I have an idea, why don't we try to do it both at the same time?<p>
Bruiser:Oh yes! That is a brilliant idea.<p>
Referee:  Will you two please start fighting.<p>
Bruiser and Hammer head together: We are trying to.<p>
Referee: Well get on with it then.<p>
Bruiser: We were trying to decide who goes first.<p>
Referee: (Astonished)Who goes first? Who goes first? This is a boxing match not a game of Trivial Pursuits. Now get on with it.<p>
Hammerhead: Shall we count to three then have a punch<p>
Bruiser: Yes, Will you count or shall I<p>
Hammerhead: I am quite happy for you to count.<p>
Alice: (Loudly) Hammerhead will you start boxing, you are wasting time you will never knock him out like that.<p>
Hammerhead: Shhh Alice we are just about to start.<p>
Alice: About time too!<p>
Bruiser: Ok I'll count then shall I?<p>
Hammerhead: ok then <p>
Bruiser: one – two – three<p>
(There is laughter from both Bruiser and Hammer head)<p>
Hammerhead: Oh I am sorry Bruiser I missed completely.<p>
Bruiser: Yes, so did I. I feel such a fool.<p>
Hammerhead: Me too.<p>
Bruiser: Shall we try it again?<p>
Referee: (exasperated) This is the very, very worst boxing match I have ever experienced. Will one of you please throw a punch<p>
Hammerhead:  Be quiet referee, you are putting us off.<p>
Referee: Well get on with it then.<p>
Tom: (Loudly) Bruiser, You should be boxing. You look like you are out for a Sunday afternoon stroll.<p>
Bruiser: We are going to be Boxing, just be patient.<p>
Tom: Anyone would think you two had never boxed in your life<p>
Bruiser: You count this time Hammerhead<p>
Hammerhead: Ok. one – two..... Oh can I just say something?<p>
Bruiser: Of course.<p>
Hammerhead: I really like your shorts<p>
Bruiser: Oh thanks. They are new, this is the fist time I have worn them.<p>
Hammerhead: I thought they looked new, Can I ask where you bought them.<p>
Bruiser: (Whispers) Primark, don't tell anyone though.<p>
Bruiser: Your secret is safe with me<p>
Referee: Please, for goodness sake box?<p>
Bruiser: I can't see the sense in paying a lot of money at a sports shop when Primark is so much cheaper.<p>
Hammerhead: Yes you are right, these gloves cost a fortune<p>
Bruiser: Oh, don't talk to me about gloves. They are about twice the price they were last year.<p>
Hammerhead: And the quality is not so good.<p>
Tom: (Loudly) Bruiser if you don't start boxing soon I will resign.<p>
 Bruiser: Don't be silly Tom, we are going to box, just having a little chat first.<p>
Tom: You are supposed to be punching him, not chatting to him.<p>
Bruiser: That seems very rude to me Tom, to start punching him in the middle of a conversation<p>
Tom: You are not supposed to be in a conversation, you are supposed to be boxing.<p>
 ( A bell rings)<p>
Referee: End of round one. (exasperated) And as yet no points to either of them. Back your corners please<p>
Tom: What on Earth are you playing at Bruiser that was a disgrace.<p>
Bruiser: Oh don't go on at me Tom. Hammerhead is a very nice chap and we were getting on so well<p>
Tom: you were not supposed to be getting on so well, you were supposed to be boxing.<p>
Alice: Hammerhead, that was the worst, the very worst behaviour I have ever seen in a boxing ring.<p>
 Hammerhead: I disagree Alice I thought we were both very polite.<p>
Alice: That is the problem. You are not supposed to be polite, you are supposed to knocking him for six.<p>
Tom: This is round two Bruiser so I want to see some big changes. For Goodness sake, start boxing.<p>
Alice: This is your big fight hammerhead and you are throwing it away. When you get back in the ring You have to start boxing<p>
( A bell rings)<p>
Referee: Round two. Now come on lads, start boxing.<p>

Bruiser:  Tom was moaning at me. Does Alice go on at you like that Hammerhead?<p>
Hammerhead:  Yes, all the time. Can never please her. It's like punch him here, punch him there. Never happy with what I do.<p>
Bruiser: Yes I know what you mean. Moan, moan, moan.<p>
Hammerhead: And try to take a day off from training and you think I would have asked for the world<p>
Bruiser: Same for me but I put my foot down and took a week off last month.<p>
Hammerhead: Good for you, Did you go anywhere nice?<p>
Referee: Please, please, please, please. Will you please start boxing.<p>
Bruiser: I went to Cromer<p>
Hammerhead: Oh yes. Norfolk isn't it?<p>
Bruiser: That's right, yes. We had a lovely week, me and my wife.<p>
Hammerhead: Oh you are married too then?<p>
Bruiser: Yes 5 years now. How about you?<p>
Hammerhead: 2 years for us. Got any kids?<p>
Bruiser: Just the one, two years old<p>
Hammerhead: Aww lovely.<p>
 Referee: Right! This nonsense has gone on long enough. I insist you two start boxing.<p>
Alice: (loudly) I insist too<p>
Tom: (Also loudly) And I also insist.<p>
Hammerhead: Will you lot please be quiet. We are trying to have a conversation here<p>
Referee: You are not supposed to be having a conversation. You are supposed to be boxing B-O-X-I-N-G boxing!<p>
Bruiser: He's beginning to get on my nerves<p>
Hammerhead: I know, mine too<p>
Bruiser:I suppose he's right though, We are here to box<p>
Hammerhead: I just didn't feel much like it today.<p>
Bruiser: That's funny, nor did I.<p>
Tom:  Bruiser please! Box, box, box<p>
 Hammerhead: Shall we just shuffle around a bit, make it look like we are trying?<p>
Bruiser: yes, we could do, you go that way around and I'll go this way.<p>
Hammerhead: Yes, that would look good<p>
Bruiser: We should make some noises too, like woomph and oomph<p>
Hammerhead: Yes, they seem to like that<p>
Bruiser: oomph<p>
Hammerhead: woomph <p>
Referee: What is going on? Oomph, woomph  That is not boxing!<p>
Hammerhead: It's a bit like boxing<p>
Referee: It is nothing like boxing<p>
Alice: Exactly. It is nothing like boxing. It is just saying Oomph and woomph <p>
Tom: And if there isn't some proper boxing soon I'm going home.<p>
Bruiser: Ok, ok we'll box<p>
Hammerhead: Yes, I suppose we ought to start or we'll never hear the end of it.<p>
Bruiser: Didn't you have a match last week?<p>
Hammerhead: Yes, with Mad Dog Mauler.<p>
Bruiser:  I thought so.<p>
Hammerhead: I don't know why they call him Mad Dog though. He is a really nice chap.<p>
 Bruiser: Yes I had heard that. <p>
Hammerhead: We discovered we both have Sausage dogs<p>
 Bruiser: Really? I think they are so cute.<p>
Hammerhead: They are lovely dogs, so affectionate<p>
Bruiser: We've got a West Highland Terrier<p>
Hammerhead: They are very sweet dogs too.<p>
Bruiser: So did you win the match?<p>
Hammerhead: To be honest with you, we didn't really get started.<p>
 Bruiser: A bit like tonight then?<p>
Hammerhead: Sometimes you just don't feel in the mood<p>
Referee: Box, box, box.<p>
Alice: I have almost had enough of this. Unless the start soon I'm going home<p>
Tom: Me too.<p>
Bruiser:  (Loudly) Alright, alright, alright we'll box.<p>
Hammerhead: Come on Bruiser, take a punch at me before they all go crazy.<p>
Bruiser: Ok, are you sure that's alright?<p>
Hammerhead: Of course. Be careful of my right shoulder though.<p>
Bruiser: Oh have you got a problem with it then? <p>
Hammerhead: Yes, It's been playing me up all week.<p>
Bruiser: Sorry to hear that.
Hammerhead: I think it happened when I put my jacket on awkwardly.<p>
Bruiser: Would you like a Paracetamol, I've got some in my bag<p>
Hammerhead: That would be helpful, if you wouldn't mind.<p>
( Bell rings) <p>
Referee: End of round two, no points scored, end of the match and I don't think I will ever referee again so the end of me too. I'm going home.<p>
Alice: So am I, worst boxing match ever, Goodbye everyone.<p>
Tom: I'm with you Alice, Goodbye to you all, I am finished with boxing.<p>
Hammerhead: Well it seems like it is all over.<p>
Bruiser: Well, we didn't feel like it anyway. Do you fancy going for a coffee?<p>
Hammerhead: Yes good idea, let's get out of this ring and get changed.<p>
(There is a loud crash)<p>
Hammerhead ( shouting wildly) WAIT, WAIT EVERYONE. Bruiser has fallen out of the ring – I think he is knocked out<p>
